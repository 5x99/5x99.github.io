## Introduction

This is an example blog post demonstrating the **automatic Table of Contents** feature. The TOC is automatically generated from your post's heading hierarchy.

Just write your content with proper headings (h2, h3, h4), and the JavaScript will automatically:
- Generate IDs for your headings
- Extract them into a TOC
- Display them in the sidebar
- Highlight which section you're currently reading (scroll spy)

No manual front matter configuration needed!

## Getting Started

The automatic TOC generation is intelligent and handles everything for you. Just focus on writing good content with clear headings.

### Installation

There's nothing to install - it's built into the site automatically!

The JavaScript runs on page load and:
1. Scans the page for headings (h2, h3, h4)
2. Generates anchor IDs if missing
3. Creates the TOC sidebar
4. Enables scroll spy tracking

### Configuration

Best practices for TOC:
- Use h2 for major sections
- Use h3 for subsections  
- Use h4 for sub-subsections
- Keep heading text descriptive and concise
- Don't skip heading levels (go h2 → h3 → h4, not h2 → h4)

## Features

### Automatic ID Generation

If you write a heading like `## My Amazing Section`, the script automatically creates an ID like `my-amazing-section` and makes it linkable.

### Scroll Spy

As you scroll down the page, the TOC automatically highlights which section you're currently viewing. This helps readers know where they are in the document.

### Nested Levels

The TOC properly handles nested heading levels with visual indentation:
- H2 headings are top-level
- H3 headings are indented slightly
- H4 headings are indented more

### Mobile Friendly

On smaller screens, the TOC sidebar collapses and adapts to the smaller viewport while remaining functional.

## Best Practices

Here are tips for effective content structure:

### Keep It Organized

- Start with h2 for your intro section
- Use h3 for subsections
- Avoid too many heading levels (max h2-h4)
- One h1 per page (the title)

### Write Clear Headings

Good headings make for a good TOC:
- **Good**: "Installation Steps", "Configuration Options", "Troubleshooting"
- **Avoid**: "Misc", "Other stuff", "Info"

### Content Length

The TOC shines with longer posts:
- Quick articles: minimal TOC, still works fine
- Deep dives: TOC really helps readers navigate
- References: TOC becomes essential for usability

## Advanced Tips

### Creating Table-Like References

You can use regular Markdown to create reference-style content:

```markdown
## API Reference

### GET /users

Returns a list of users.

### POST /users

```

### Using Markdown Features

Combine Markdown features with clear heading structure:
- **Bold text** for emphasis
- _Italic_ for less emphasis
- `Code` for technical terms
- Lists for multiple items

## Conclusion

The automatic TOC generation makes it simple to create well-structured, navigable content. Write your content naturally with clear headings, and let the system handle the rest!

**Try it yourself**: Just use h2, h3, and h4 headings in your posts, and watch the TOC populate automatically in the sidebar. As you scroll, the TOC will highlight your current section.
