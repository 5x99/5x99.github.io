## Introduction

This is an example blog post demonstrating the Table of Contents feature. The TOC is automatically generated from the `toc` array in the front matter.

When you add a `toc` section to your post's front matter, it will appear in the sidebar under "On This Page" for easy navigation.

## Getting Started

To use the table of contents feature, simply add a `toc` array to your post's front matter with entries for each section.

### Installation

Each entry in the `toc` array should have:
- `title`: The display text for the TOC entry
- `url`: The anchor link (should match the heading ID)
- `level`: The heading level (2 for h2, 3 for h3, etc.)

### Configuration

Make sure your heading IDs match the URLs in your TOC. Kramdown automatically generates IDs from heading text, converting spaces to hyphens and lowercasing.

For example:
- `## My Section` → `id="my-section"`
- `### Sub Section` → `id="sub-section"`

## Best Practices

Here are some tips for effective use of the table of contents:

### Tips and Tricks

- Keep heading hierarchy logical (don't skip levels, e.g., h2 → h4)
- Use descriptive heading text that conveys the section's purpose
- Limit TOC entries to major sections for better readability
- Test that your anchor links work by clicking them in the sidebar

## Conclusion

The table of contents feature helps readers navigate longer posts and improves user experience. It's especially useful for technical articles and tutorials.
