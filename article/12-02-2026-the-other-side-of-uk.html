The problems faced by white people in UK are often ignored by the authorities. Clacton-on-Sea and its neighbor Jaywick are the most deprived places in the UK, with 96.1% of the population being white. Anyone who has been to Jaywick understands that ineffective management can ruin the lives of many people. It was once a resort town with an excellent view of the sea, where you would arrive and not believe that you were in miserable England. All because tourists stopped coming here as they used to. The name "Crackton-on-Sea" now better describes this town, with absolute unemployment; even Sainsbury's closed due to the great depression created here by the government. To prevent this from happening and to strengthen the city, it is necessary to diversify the economy, but apparently the center of civilization was unable to do so because it had always focused on foreign policy rather than domestic issues. In conclusion, white people should not build their lives in cities whose development depends on a single industry, especially in the UK, because the government will simply forget about you and will not effectively stimulate your city's economy.
